# Contributing

## Local setup
- Install Python 3.11+ (for tooling).
- Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit`.
- Run `pre-commit install` to enable the git hook.

## Checks before pushing
- `pre-commit run --all-files` to ensure hygiene checks pass.

## Workflow
- Use short-lived feature branches; keep `main` clean.
- Prefer small, focused commits with clear messages.
- Open PRs for review when possible.
